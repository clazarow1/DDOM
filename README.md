## Welcome to the Create PT Project!

This is my Create PT (Performance Task) for AP Computer Science Principles.

I decided to take a challenge and take on Python, and this taught me a lot of experience with using other languages for writing programs especially when it comes to downloading samples from a website and a provided list.

This will guide Python learning for your Create PT task in Computer Science Principles.

This project as a whole was inspired by Endermanch on YouTube, who originally modified the code for Python. Take a look at his code in the "Original Files" folder, in which will contain everything he created, or check out his repository at https://github.com/endermanch/MalwareDatabase

When I ran the "main.py" file, I included the samples I downloaded from this application alone, and hopes this will help you get on the ground running.
